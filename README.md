### DADI Express App

The DADI Express App is a simple Node JS application designed to give us a small glimpse into your coding practice. It is not essential to return a fully functional application, although that would be amazing.

Please use the included HTML templates to generate an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application.

Some things to consider:

* **templating language**: while we currently use Dust in our products, you can choose any
templating language you are familiar with
* **data source**: again, up to you! it can be static data or you can hook up to an API
to provide data
* **unit testing**: not essential, but the inclusion of a functional test suite would be nice
to see
* **logging**: an HTTP request log, to file or console, would also be a nice touch

Please create a GitHub repository for your application and send us the link when ready, along with instructions for installing and running it.

_Have fun!_
